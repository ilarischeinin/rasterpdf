Description: The ability to plot raster graphics in PDF files can be useful
    when one needs multipage documents, but the plots contain so many
    individual elements that (the usual) use of vector graphics results in
    inconveniently large file sizes. Internally, rasterpdf plots each
    individual page as a PNG, and then combines them in one PDF file.
